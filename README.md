## Strategy

Developing this mobile application, I intentionally did not use any third party library as the tools of that kind definitely help, but also they tend to skip several steps of the native process of development. Thus, I took on a challenge to go through every step myself, and learn, and experiment, and see how everything happens behind the scenes. Undoubtedly, a great learning experience that helped me grasp a deeper understanding of working with the data from an `API`.

## User Stories

- As a user, I see a collection of NASA images together with their titles on the first screen of this app,
- As a user, I scroll down to see further the collection of images presented as thumbnails,
- As a user, I see a detailed view of a single image by tapping on a thumbnail,
- As a user, I see the image I chose in a detailed view specifying its title, location, photographer and description if there's data provided) on the same screen,
- As a user, I am presented with a readable alert message in case of unprecedented technical occurrences,
- As a user, I want to be able to see every single thumbnail image in a detailed view screen.
